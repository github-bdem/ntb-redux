# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an LM-powered bot for playing the video game Nuclear Throne. The project uses TypeScript with Node.js.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Run the project in development mode with auto-reload
- `npm start` - Run the compiled JavaScript (requires build first)
- `npm run clean` - Remove the dist directory

### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code issues
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues where possible
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking without building

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- `/src` - TypeScript source code
  - `index.ts` - Main entry point
- `/dist` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by build)
- TypeScript configured with strict mode and ES2022 target
- ESLint configured with TypeScript-specific rules and Prettier integration
- Node.js ES modules enabled

### Key Technologies
- TypeScript 5.8+ with strict type checking
- Node.js with ES modules
- ESLint with @typescript-eslint for code quality
- Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Project Status

- TypeScript development environment configured
- ESLint and Prettier set up with best practices
- Basic project structure established
- Ready for Nuclear Throne bot implementation

When developing this project, consider:
- The bot will need to interface with Nuclear Throne (likely through screen capture, game API, or similar)
- Language model integration will be required for decision-making
- Performance considerations for real-time game interaction
